# URP Dynamic Diffuse

An implementation of the ["Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination with Ray-Traced Irradiance Fields" paper](https://jcgt.org/published/0008/02/01/), as well as [RTX-DDGI repo](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/RTXGI-DDGI).

Many improvements were borrowed from [Timberdoodle's](https://github.com/Sunset-Flock/Timberdoodle/) PGI system.
